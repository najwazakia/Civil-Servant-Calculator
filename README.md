# Civil-Servant-Calculator
This program is a final project that me and my friends initiated for the subject "Algorithm and Programming"

This program allows user to calculate civil servants' basic salary and allowances based on their class/rank, marital status, number of children, and position.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that this program may contain inaccurate data that is not relatable on current situation. This program was only written to show how programming in C++ works.
